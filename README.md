## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

* The data for the course project can be found @ https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
  Download the data to a folder on your local machine e.g. c:\coursera\getting and cleaning data\project\
  unzipping the data in c:\coursera\getting and cleaning data\project\ will create a subfolder \UCI HAR Dataset\ containing the data


* place the R script run_analysis.R in the top level data folder \UCI HAR Dataset\


* set your working directory to be the top level data folder
  e.g setwd("c:\\coursera\\getting and cleaning data\\project\\UCI HAR Dataset\\")

* run the R script 
  source("run_analysis.R")

* The run_analysis.R script performs the following actions.

  loads the feature descriptions from \UCI HAR Dataset\features.txt
  loads the activity descriptions from \UCI HAR Dataset\activity_labels.txt

  It then loads the test data, combining readings, subjects and activities data

  \UCI HAR Dataset\test\X_test.txt
  \UCI HAR Dataset\test\subject_test.txt
  \UCI HAR Dataset\test\y_test.txt

  In the process both features and activities are given their descriptive names, 
  futher more only mean and standard deviation feature columns are retained

  The same process is repeated for the training data

  \UCI HAR Dataset\train\X_train.txt
  \UCI HAR Dataset\train\subject_train.txt
  \UCI HAR Dataset\train\y_train.txt
  
  Next test and training datasets are combined using rbind

  The merged and cleaned data is written to the file \UCI HAR Dataset\merged_clean_data.csv

  Finally a summarized dataset is produced which provides the average of each feature for each activity and subject
  This summarized dataset is written to the file \UCI HAR Dataset\mean_features_by_subject_activity.csv
